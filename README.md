# Super Madiao Game

## Project Overview
Our game (Super Madiao!) is based on a traditional Chinese card game called **Madiao**. The backend supports the mechanics of gameplay (such as playing cards, declarations, and challenge-calling) while the frontend (GUI) supports the display. The objective is to get rid of all the cards in your hand before your opponent does.

## Features
- **Backend**: Game logic, class structure, and core mechanics. Covers game entities such as cards, players, and overall gameplay management
- **Frontend**: GUI in Java Swing/AWT
- **Testing**: Unit tests, plus the main method for demonstration, to test different parts of the game
- **Documentation**: This README, the UML diagram, and some additional notes
